<h2> JavaScript Promise </h2>
<p>The <strong>Promise</strong> object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting value.
</p>


<p> There is no such difference between callback function and promise. You can say it is just syntactic sugar </p>
Here is the cases where you can refer a promise rather than callback  
<ul>
  <li> When you are dealing with asynchronous task </li>
  <li> You want to right clean code in case of event handling or to remove nested function with easier function</li>
</ul>
